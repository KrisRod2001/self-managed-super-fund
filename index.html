        <h2>What is an SMSF?</h2>
        <p>Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) have become increasingly popular in Australia, especially since legislative changes in 2007 allowed SMSFs to borrow for investment properties via Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangements (LRBAs). An SMSF gives you control over your retirement savings, including the ability to invest directly in property for potential capital growth and rental income.</p>

    <section id="rules">
        <h2>Key Rules and Restrictions</h2>
        <p>All SMSF investments must pass the <strong>sole purpose test</strong>: solely for providing retirement benefits.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannot purchase residential property from related parties.</li>
            <li>No personal use: Fund members or relatives cannot live in or use the property.</li>

    </section>

    <section id="process">
        <h2>The Conveyancing Process for SMSF Property</h2>
        <p>SMSF property transactions are more complex than standard conveyancing due to superannuation laws. Key steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contract review to ensure correct entity (SMSF trustee or bare trust).</li>
            <li>Compliance checks with ATO rules and investment strategy.</li>
            <li>Coordination of finance (if borrowing via LRBA).</li>
            <li>Stamp duty assessment and payment.</li>
            <li>Settlement and title registration in the correct name.</li>
            <li>Post-settlement transfer from bare trust to SMSF once loan is repaid.</li>
        </ul>
